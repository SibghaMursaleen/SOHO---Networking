# SOHO and IoT Network Design and Implementation

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network with IoT integration using Cisco Packet Tracer. It showcases a smart and secure home-office environment with essential connectivity, automation, and real-time monitoring.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- IoT Devices (Smart Fans, Lights, Thermostats)
- Wireless Router, Switches, PCs, Servers
- Sensors (Motion, Temperature)
- Programming Logic via Packet Tracer Simulation

## 📌 Features
- Efficient SOHO network topology
- Secure device interconnection (wired + wireless)
- Smart home automation (IoT devices)
- Real-time sensor feedback and control
- Access control and basic firewall rules

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn and implement SOHO network design principles
- Integrate IoT devices for automation and smart control
- Simulate communication between IoT and server
- Demonstrate real-time data transmission and remote access
